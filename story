Once there lived a farmer in the crest of the low hill named lencho. He was looking at north to get at least a shower for his corn field.
The corn field looked like draped in a curtain of seeds, after sometime big drops of rain began to fall. Lencho was very happy to see the rain and 
said his wife that with joy. For sometime it was going in a smooth way ,then the rain changed into hailstorm and the hailstones destroyed all the 
crops in his field.
